# ProgramSearch

"In order to tractibly learn a synthesis policy, and use an enumerative search mechanism (similar to AlphaGo), we require that the nodes in our search graph are renderable programs, which, when rendered, form the type of specifications which our search policy is conditioned on." ... is that something like it? (This is just Max spitballing)
