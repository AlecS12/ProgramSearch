# TODO THINGS

## ROBUST FILL REAL TRAINING TESTING
- [ ] Parallelize Data Generation
- [ ] Formalise Train / Test Scaffold

## ROBUST FILL ABLATION STUDIES 
- [ ] With / Without Intermediates (big / smol buttons) (with / without scratch)
- [ ] With / Without Value Function 
- [ ] Normal RobustFill (RNN)
- [ ] Robustfill which renders and then commits for each line (like Xinyun and Kevin)
- [ ] Beam Search vs A* (pending . . . )

## OTHER DOMAINS
- [ ] Numpy Manipulations
- [ ] ??? With Long Programs
- [ ] CAD -- figure out situation there


## WRITING/PITCHING
- [ ] write for ICML workshop paper
- [ ] Ask advisors for help pitching our approach
