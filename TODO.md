# TODO THINGS

## ROBUST FILL REAL TRAINING TESTING
- [ ] Parallelize Data Generation
- [ ] Formalise Train / Test Scaffold

## ROBUST FILL ABLATION STUDIES 
- [x] With / Without Intermediates (with / without scratch) (maybe lower priority)
- [ ] With / Without Value Function 
- [ ] Normal RobustFill (RNN)
- [ ] Robustfill which renders and then commits for each line (like Xinyun and Kevin) (also maybe lower priority)
- [ ] Beam Search vs A* (pending . . . )
- [ ] SMC
- [ ] MCTS

## OTHER DOMAINS
- [ ] Numpy Manipulations
- [ ] ??? With Long Programs
- [ ] CAD -- figure out situation there

## WRITING/PITCHING
- [ ] write for ICML workshop paper
- [ ] Ask advisors for help pitching our approach

Kevin's input: let's focus more on formalizing the MDP situation and pushing on the search + value function additions, which are what seperate us from prior work
